# Client Side Installation Guide

This guide will help you install the necessary packages for the client side of your project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the client directory:**

    Open your terminal and navigate to the client directory of your project.

    ```
    cd path/to/your/project/client
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    Run the following command to install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

    ```

3. **Start the client application:**

    After the installation is complete, you can start the client application using the following command:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and you can view your application in the browser.

## Additional Information
